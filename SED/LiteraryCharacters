#This command gets rid of all the text besides the First name, last name, and phone number.
#It does this by selecting the beginning of the line and then substitutes using ':[0-9]* .*' as
#the search parameter. It's setup to select these specific letters because it needs to get the
#2nd colon in the line and not the first one, like without the space between '* .*' it would pick
#the first colon and delete everything besides the name.
/^/{s/:[0-9]* .*//}
#This next command is used to get rid of the last name.
#It does this by substituting, and it first goes to the first colon in the line, and then grabs
#any letters between that colon and the first space. Finally it replaces all the selected
#characters with a space, so the phone number isn't right next to the name.

#This last command searches for Arya wich is the last line in the file, then it uses $a which
#appends the text to the end of the file.
